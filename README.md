# Formation selection tool for Football game

**1st year course project** allows formation and selection of players for football team

## Domain description

Fantasy Football (the sport that you play predominantly with your feet, not the sport that
involves Beyoncé appearing at half time (not that there’s anything wrong with Beyoncé))
allows sports enthusiasts and nerds alike to choose a squad of 15 players, and field 11 of
these players each week to play in a fictional team. Using a points system, the performance
of the players in a fantasy manager’s fictional team, in real life, then impacts the score of
the manager, every week. In this project, we will not focus on Fantasy Football scoring.

The selection of a squad, and the selection of a team, is managed by a a graphical user
interface. A fantasy manager can select two goalkeepers, five defensive players, five midfield
players and three attacking players as part of their squad. The interface facilitates this
selection, and then allows the manager to choose eleven of the fifteen players to ‘start’
each week, with the remaining four players sitting on a fictional bench. Choosing which
players start is done (in part) by selecting a team formation. Team formation does not directly
affect the choice of goalkeeper, which we will assume, in this project, does not change (i.e.
the same goalkeeper is always sat on the bench regardless of the formation).

## Code

It's a Java program allowing the user to choose a formation and then select players to form a team.

## Aims

* To better understand, and critique, the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern;
* To practice further with the use of widgets (components) and event handlers;
* To work with new components, and other aspects of Swing, such as the dropdown
box and the File Chooser.
